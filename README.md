# Gatsby + Stripe API Checkout Demo
A quick demonstration of how to use/setup the new Stripe API Checkout feature with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). Based on a tutorial by [Jason Lengstorf](https://twitter.com/jlengstorf). 

In this example, we are working with a singular product. But the Stripe API Checkout is capable of much more and could support an e-commerce store. The best thing about the new checkout feature is how easy it is to set up.
